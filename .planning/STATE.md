# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-10-16)

**Core value:** An operator running a F.A.S.T. step from Galago can always see what the instrument
is doing and recover it themselves; no adapter code path pauses, resumes or aborts on its own.
**Current focus:** Planning next milestone (`/gsd-new-milestone`)

## Current Position

Phase: Milestone v1 complete
Plan: —
Status: Awaiting next milestone
Last activity: 2026-10-16 — Milestone v1 completed and archived

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Full log in PROJECT.md Key Decisions; v1 per-plan decisions archived with the phases in
`.planning/milestones/v1-phases/`. Carried into the next milestone:

- Claude sends `Configure` only on the user's explicit request and only with no run in flight
  (logged exception T-03-05/T-03-08, 2026-10-16).
- Deploy order stays core → `galago-tools` → `galago-web`; back up `F.A.S.T.log` before any restart.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- fast-mcp `fix/run-recovery-gate` (holding `76f8c3f` and `b30b38d`) is not on GitLab; a clean
  install from the pin fails until it is pushed. Install from the local clone meanwhile.
- WR-02 (`_is_no_error`'s loose `in (None, 0)` check) — v2 debt, medium, reporting only.
- galago-core debt out of this repo's scope: run-page Gantt bar draws past an abort; "Connect all
  tools" sends empty configs; "Item N not found" when the queue clears mid-abort; F.A.S.T. tool-page
  status can render stale after a reconnect.
- Branches on both repos are not pushed (deferred D-02) — pushing is the user's own action; push
  only to the `nikkopg` fork remote.

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and deferred at milestone close, most recent first:
